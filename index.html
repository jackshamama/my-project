        <h3>Yes, Shamama is my real last name </h3>

<p>Now that we've gotten that out of the way, here's some more about me: I'm a Product Manager, Film Producer, and Writer with over 15 years of experience working on a diverse array of projects. 

As a Product Manager I managed some of the best-known gay brands, including NakedSword,  Falcon Studios, and Gay.com. At Falcon, after conducting extensive market research and analysis, I oversaw a complete rebranding and relaunch of several of their core brands, which lead to to significant increase in sales across all channels. 

As a Produer, I produced the feature film "I Want Your Love", which received critical acclaim (<em>The New York Times</em> called it "a conscious effort to take back gay sex on film", <em>Indiewire</em> said it was "a must see," and the <em>London Guardian</em> called it "a welcome shift in queer cinema") as well as commercial success. I also produced the documentary "Seed Money: The Chuck Holmes Story", which has screened in film festivals around the world.

As a writer, I got my first article was published in <em>Out Magazine</em> while I was an undergrad and have since contributed to numerous online and print publications. I started blogging in 2002. In 2004 I started one of the most popular blogs on gay adult film, which has won numerous awards. in 2014-15, I wrote science-related feature articles for the Discovery Channel's blog TestTube.com.
